 Learning outcomes
 -link an external js file
 -changing text in divs from js
 -calling a function from html
 -styling is not something I enjoy very much

 Future goals
 -get rid of scrollbar at the bottom
 -make the 5 appear before the alert pops up... could just get rid of the alert
 -make the alert message better

 Overall quick project, maybe 5 hours from reading the prompt to pushing it! 
 (and almost an hour of that was spent figuring out how to get my files linked)
